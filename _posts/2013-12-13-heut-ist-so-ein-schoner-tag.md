Every father has not insignificant aspirations for their children's performance, especially in activities that are close to dad's heart.  So Tina was justifiably a little bit apprihensive about us skipping ski school and having me teach the kids to ski myself.

I'd binge watched youtube for every teach-kids-to-ski clip out there. Some where good, some where not so, but I a pretty good idea of what to expect.  Start on the flat, go slow, and positive encouragement only.  Yeah, yeah, yeah....what do they know.

For once though, I took the wife's advice to heart and lowered my expectations.  Maybe _Miss 5_ could be doing reds after a month.  We found a bunny slop and started sslloooowwww.  I needn't have worried though. _Miss 5_ took to it like a duck to water and was on reds after 4 days. #prouddad.

In the meantime, Tina took _Mr 2_ up the mountain to play in the snow and enjoy plenty of hot chocolate.  Everyone is having a blast so far.
