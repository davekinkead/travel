We had family visit us at Christmas and it was wonderful, my best memory is dancing around the Christmas tree with the presents around it singing Christmas carols. 

Mr K who is 2 thought it was awesome and had a big smile on his face during every song. Christmas has been great for the kids, every morning in December there was a piece of chocolate or a small present in their santa hats, they got quite used to expect a little suprise every morning. However, often dissapointed about getting a small toy instead of chocolate.
