We arrived in Ried im Zillertal after 33 hours of travel, door to door. The children was very happy to arrive at their new home, after having endoured the stress of parents packing down their Brisbane home, a plane trip with endless hours of boredom, dvd watching, and 3 airport stops, a new home was a relif. 

They found Austria very cold but was very keen to put on warm clothes, beanies and gloves but they could not help themselves touching and kicking the snow. 

They where estatic! That morning we walked through town in snailpace as we had to waith for the kids constantly, they just had to stop and touch snow every step of the way.

We arrived to a very nice apartment, absoulutely exceeded our expectations, fireplace, fully kittet kitchen, huge bathroom with a huge bath. Kingsize beds in both bathrooms and a monster TV with lots of channels.

Best of all, not only do we have access to a backyard with snow, a small hill, sleds, little forrest and toys, but also two new neighbours who are 6 & 9 yeras old girls! 

We had had some shy moments the first 2 days, but now Miss S and Mr K are happy to play outside with the girls for 2-3 hours in the afternoon when they get home from school. 

We hope this will help the kids learn a some of German!
